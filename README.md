The game is now done.
The game lasts 10 rounds in which you are trying to get the highest score.
The score is the sum of the 4 random dice, unless they are all the same.
If they are all the same number the sum is multiplied by 5.
The dice roll at the beginning of each round, you can then reroll a die 5 times per round.
You can restart a game by hitting the new game button but it will not put your high score up unless you finish all 10 rounds.
The high score isn't stored so it will reset to 0 everytime you run the program.
